EadFlix has a modern course page with an optional info banner enabled via settings.

It features an activity block system that turns uploaded images into block-style activities. This works for both Topics and Weekly formats.

## âœ¨ Recent Interface Changes

![Admin screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a757232-5323-4dbc-bae0-4549d5491956)

* Many changes were made to the structure and order of items, especially on the **Course Category** page.
* Selected courses now appear **above** the categories, not below.
* Buttons are now arranged **inline**, not stacked vertically.

### "My Courses" Page:

* The order was changed so the search field appears **at the end of the list**.
* The search field starts small and **expands when focused**, saving space when not in use.

## ðŸ”» Footer Block

The footer supports 0 to 4 fully customizable blocks. Use your creativity to add any content you like, without limitations from rigid icon or link configurations.

Even better: the "Made by" text can be removed directly in the settings at no additional cost.
